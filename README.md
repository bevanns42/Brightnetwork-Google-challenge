# Brightnetwork-Google-challenge
.
This challenge was the first time I have attempted Python. 
Setting up was a nightmare but once that hurdle was passed, I was able to use resources available to work out what is required.
The for loop for the show_all_videos command was pretty simple. 
Ordering them was not. Took a few attempts to get correct.
The play specific video was also a challenge. Adding the random function required abit of digging to find the correct soluyion.

I am proud of what i have achieved and taught myself.

When you find the solution and the code finally does what you set out to achieve it is a great feeling of relief and achievement,
followed by the determinnation and belief that you are able to do it for the next task.

You go from complete confusion, slowly figuring out what issues lie inn the code infront of you.
To finally piecing the puzzle together and compiling a functioanl solution.

This challenge was unexpected and turned out very enjoyable.
I am far from a competent developer but from this challenge, I am likely to explore programming further.

Thank you.
